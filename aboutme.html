      <p>My name is Shaun. I was born in 1988 in a small Missouri town called Warrensburg.</p>
      <p>I moved away in 2009 when I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. I was assigned to Lackland AFB in TX, Keesler AFB in MS, Altus AFB in OK, and Andersen AFB on the remote island of Guam.</p>
      <p>In all, I spent more than seven years in the service as an Air Traffic Controller. I spent another year-plus in the same profession as a civilian.</p>
      <p>I am 30 years old now and working on my third career. Armed with very little (basically zero) experience with the field, I chose to pursue a career in Computer Programming.</p>
